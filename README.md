# PuTTY with GSS-API key exchange
***

This repository contains the
[PuTTY SSH client](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/),
patched to support GSS-API key exchange and [Heimdal](http://www.h5l.org/).
It also contains patches to build a Win64-version of PuTTY, complete
with support for the 64-bit versions of
[Heimdal for Windows](https://www.secure-endpoints.com/heimdal/) and
[MIT Kerberos for Windows](http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/dist/index.html#kfw-4.0),
and better support for building with MinGW.

You may find binaries [here](https://marcussundberg.com/putty/).
